        <p>We collect personal information that you provide directly to us, such as your name, email address, phone number, and payment details when you create an account or make a booking. We may also collect information about your travel preferences and history.</p>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your personal information to process your bookings, provide customer support, send you important updates about your travel plans, and improve our services.

        <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We may share your information with travel service providers (such as airlines, hotels, and car rental companies) to fulfill your bookings.
